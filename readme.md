# PokeRoute (alpha)

PokeRoute is a gps route optimizer built for Pokemon GO.

Enter gps coordinates for your Pokemon and you'll get the fastest route through all of the pokemon.
You can check Pokemon off the list and you see the distance to the next spot together with the cooldown for Pokemon GO spoofing.
