# PokeRoute

PokeRoute is a gps route optimizer built for Pokemon GO.

Enter gps coordinates for your Pokemon and you'll get the fastest route through all of the pokemon.
You can check Pokemon off the list and you see the distance to the next spot together with the cooldown for Pokemon GO spoofing.

## Possible features:

- GPX downloading (gpx generation works, but download isn't triggered yet)
- Team background as a setting instead of random
- Better theming
